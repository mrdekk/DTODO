For this project, I have special thanks to

1. Developers and contributors of [Yggdrasil](https://yggdrasil-network.github.io) project for a communication system, that allows to connect some iOS devices together
2. Authors, developers and contributors of DHT (Distributed Hash Table) and related things to be able to discovery other peers
3. Author and creator of [AppDecentral](https://appdecentral.com) site and it's related [repository](https://github.com/appdecentral/replicatingtypes) for basic things on replicating data types, that I've used as basic for this project

And all, whom I've not noticed, but invent some things, I used in this demo project
